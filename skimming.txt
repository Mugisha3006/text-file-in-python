Most ancient cultures, including Ancient Greece,[21] Ancient China, and Ancient India,[22] lacked the concept of creativity, seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation. The ancient Greeks had no terms corresponding to "to create" or "creator" except for the expression "poiein" ("to make"), which only applied to poiesis (poetry) and to the poietes (poet, or "maker" who made it). Plato did not believe in art as a form of creation. Asked in The Republic,[23] "Will we say of a painter that he makes something?" he answers, "Certainly not, he merely imitates."[21]
